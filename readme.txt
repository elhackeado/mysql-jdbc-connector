# mysql-jdbc-connector
this repository contains the mysql-jdbc connector for the integration of mysql database with java database connectivity.
the repository contains a file named "mysql-connector-java-5.1.21.jar" which is needed to be copied in the following java directories  
------C:/java/jdk/jre/lib/ext
------C:/java/jre/lib/ext
after copying the "mysql-connector-java-5.1.21.jar" folder you can just enjoy the mysql-jdbc.
I have also included a DB.java file for the connectivity purposes which can be used to connect with database through the JAVA platform.
